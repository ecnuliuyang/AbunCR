Description: This package allows for the maximum likelihood abundance estimation
    for abundance under capture-recapture models when covariates are missing at random.
    We calculate the maximum empirical likelihood estimates of the abundance and 
    parameters in the capture probability. We also give a empirical likelihood ratio 
    confidence interval of the abundance. In addition, we provide the corresponding estimates 
    based on the inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation methods.
