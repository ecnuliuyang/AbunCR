# CRAbun
Some new methods are developed to make statistical inference for the abundance under capture-recapture models.
Below are key functions in this package.


### CRMiss function
When covariates are missing at random, four estimation methods for the abundance are carried out 
under capture-recapture models.

First method is a new maximum empirical likelihood estimation method (MELE).
Refer to Liu et al. (2019+).

Second method is based on the naive maximum empirical likelihood derived from the complete cases (CC).
See Liu et al. (2017).

The last two are based on the inverse probability weighting (IPW) and multiple imputation (MI) methods.
See Lee et al. (2016).
