# CRAbun
This package aims to show how to implement empirical likelihood (EL) methods under the Huggin-Alho model in capture-recapture studies.
As an example, we analyze a real data to show how to reproduce the results of Table 3 in Liu et al. (2020+).

## Instruction about CRAbun package
### 1. A Data set named "prinia"
This dataset is composed of 6 columns:
- id: unique identifier.
- number.of.capture: number of times an individual is captured.
- tail.length: individual covariate (50mm~91.25mm) with 41 missing records.
- fat.index: 0 (nonfat) and 1 (fat), 
which respectively corresponds to level 1 and level 2-4 in original data.
- wing: individual covariate (43mm~49mm).
- wing.index: 0 (normal length) and 1 (long length), where "normal" means that the wing length ranges from 37mm to 45.5mm
and "long" means that the wing length is larger than 45.5mm.

### 2. Optimization algorithm for EL methods
To obtain the maximum EL estimator and EL ratio confidence interval of the abundance *N*, 
we provide a function **abun.opt** with 8 options.
- d: vector stands for the number of times of being captured.
- K: number stands for the number of capture occasions.
- x: vector, matrix or data.frame stands for individual covariates without missingness.
- y: vector, matrix or data.frame stands for individual covariates with missingness.
- beta.initial: vector has the same length wih the coefficients in Huggins-Alho model. 0 means that the corresponding coefficient is fixed to zero, and non-zero values are seen as initial values when optimizing.
- CI: logistic with TRUE(default) to show the EL ratio confidence interval of *N*
and FALSE to not.
- level: number stands for the confidence level with default of 0.95.
- SE: logistic with TRUE(default) to show the standard error
and FALSE to not.


### 3. Other functions
To compare the performance of the proposed EL methods and the existing 
inverse probability weighting (IPW) and multiple impution (MI) methods
proposed by Lee et al. (2016),
we give two functions:
- **ipw.mar**: used to implement the IPW method.
- **mi2.mar**: used to implement the MI method.
